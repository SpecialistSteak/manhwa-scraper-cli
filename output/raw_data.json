She wasn't royalty, I think, and I don't remember if she died later, sorry TT) who was the mother of the protagonist.\n\nI know, it's a very vague and confusing description, but I think if anyone has read will have an idea of \u200b\u200bwhich one I'm referring to, I don't remember the main plot, I'm sorry, I hope you can help me please TT",

      "selftext": "There\u2019s so much about this manhwa that I found remarkable. I\u2019m particularly drawn to the characterization of Aria and the political and financial strategies that contributed significantly to the story!!! Aria acts like a genuine villainess..but she has this gradual character development where she realizes she can be a villain as a woman seeking security in a patriarchal and elitist society BUT she can still have people to trust and love. Most importantly I think it\u2019s interesting how the author made her the tsundere of the story. The ML is usually the one who acts the way she does in isekai (or romance in general). What I mean is she doesn\u2019t possess the typical characteristics you\u2019d see people associating with femininity, but she still is feminine and she didn\u2019t suddenly embrace masculinity in order to be stronger. She has trouble overcoming her past bad habits \u2014 throwing temper tantrums because of her anxiety, having severe trust issues and those issues manifesting (though it\u2019s different from her past self where she resorts to anger, in the present she resorts to aloofness). That\u2019s something I personally relate to and I\u2019m really glad I finally found an MC who isn\u2019t perfect or saintly even after suffering from problems she couldn\u2019t control. And the ML!!! He is literally the epitome of a man written by a woman. He doesn\u2019t just show that he cares for her, he makes her feel that she deserves that love and care. The way they\u2019re drawn, too \ud83e\udd79 you can feel the love in their eyes every single time they look at each other. It\u2019s the kind of love that can\u2019t be defeated by any external circumstances, it\u2019s heartwarming and just that powerful because it was built upon trust despite the fact that both of them had several reasons to be distrustful of the other\u2019s kind of people.",

The main character was a teenage boy who was trying to escape from a situation where his mom or some woman was in charge(This woman was hiding the outside world from him). An old lady acted as a mother figure to him. At one point, a girl managed to sneak into where the protag was(I believe it was a tower or some heavily militarized place),and he was hiding her until he got caught.\n\nThis was a couple of years ago and my memory might be blending details from different webtoons together, but I distinctly remember a webtoon featuring a dark-skinned girl with pink hair.

He was just with them a minute ago and suddenly hes hopping into a carting himself? Why cause he had to do a tutorial? It feels like the tutorial is 5 mins long and now the second rank is the king of a city? And Nagi is the leader of rank 1 guild?\n8. Is second rank creating a guild and trying to crush Nagi because he\u2019s salty he lost? Is she actually the villain lian in this story?

What is humanities goal in climbing the tower?\n\n\nI feel like none of these things are explained, he just needs to climb the tower and he needs to beat up some chick. He gets wickedly strong in the span of 10 days??? Like why??? His whole training was learning to run away, why is he suddenly one shoting people? Is his power electricity or super strength?? Or is it quick recovery???? Also what\u2019s up with buddy losing an arm if you can just regenerate in the tower?? \n\nTruly I want to like the story, the art is awesome.

      "selftext": "I remember reading it a while back maybe a year or so. It is a typical murim martial arts manhwa. I think it starts out with the protagonist in a forest at night fighting people from his sect (I wanna say its the demonic cult) that betrayed him and he dies after killing pretty much everyone. He then goes back in time to when he was a child and just about to be kidnapped by the sect that raised him and he manages to escape and avoid them. Then he searches for the strongest master from the orthodox side that he remembers which is a guy with like lightning body martial arts or something like that. He is rejected at first but after saving his son and taking care of his family he is accepted and starts training with him.\n\nThat is about most of what I can remember, maybe when I read it that was the extent of the story. I would greatly appreciate if anyone has read it and knows the name, I would like to check it out again.",

      "selftext": "I have read about 30 mangas and believe me when i say its a solid 7/10(Remember I gave solo leveling an 9.27/10). Even if you are not able to read the whole passage please do read the last paragraph.\nSTORY: The Story is pretty generic but the first 5 chapters will hook you up, after that it gets pretty straight forward until chapter 25-30+ were the story gets pretty interesting. After that arc there are few other arcs that get good but the real fun begins after chapter 75. I like the way the author merged in Nordic mythology into this manhawa. I suggest getting a bit information about Norse mythology beforehand. The author did tell us how magic can be created, destroyed, amplified, etc. through calculations but forgot to explain how these calculations are derived.\nA fellow manga reader @NAAlex says, \"I wanna see how the magic system works or if its just make believe. How do you actually copy a skill, what's the specific composition of what makes each skill different, whats the language or system behind it that makes it function, can you make your own skills, why do some skills cost more than others on a fundamental level. I wanna know all of this. \"\nOne downside is that the pacing is quite slow and the power scaling is also very inaccurate. For example the Main Character first defeats an S rank monster but isn't even an A rank at that time. Than he goes to defeat a S Rank Raider 'Ballack' while only being stated as an A ranker at the next chapter. But all these issues don't have a major impact on the main plot while everything else in this Manhawa is good. So the Story for me gets a Solid 6.4/10 mainly because of the unique ideas are inculcated in it.\n\nPLOT: The plot is quite clear and is very similar to solo leveling but the execution is different. There are some plot-holes and confusions but mainly due to translation errors. Coming up to the main point, and the greatest downside of this manhawa(drum rolls please) THE PLOT ARMOUR. Even though the MC doesnt have as much plot armor as boundless necromancer its still too much. The system has now given MC so many skills that its became hard to keep a track of them. He hasn't even lost a single fight yet and it's already over 100 chapters. He has so many overpowered skills like copying skills and copying Legendary ranked weapons. With the amount of plot armor given to him I bet he would be able to kill Odin even right now. There are some unanswered questions like how did MC's mother died in his previous life, etc but it really doesnt matter that much. The good part is the plot is really concise and there aren't big plot holes that ruin the story. So the plot deserves a 6.8/10.\n\nCharacters: The character development is good for some characters. The characters are diverse and are lovable(just the way I like it). The MC isn't distracted from his main goals and the occasional humor is actually good. The story keeps you hooked up, especially the mysterious characters like LOKI, THE THREE SISTERS, etc. The characters also have that comfort and soothing effect on the readers(IYKYK).The romance is quite unclear, its kind of a love triangle pointing towards a Harem but the MC doesn't seem like a harem type, so he'll have to break hearts. But again all these issues don't have a major impact on the main plot. So i'll rate characters a 8/10\n\nArt: The art is good, not the greatest but not the worst. TBH art is important but I prioritize story and plot above all so art doesnt matter for me. The art deserves 6.7/10.\n\nNow to conclude, you guys might all be wondering why I gave this Manhawa such high rating, its mainly due to the fact that this manhawa has a lot of POTENTIAL. The story keeps getting better as we proceed and so does the art. Its worth reading and enjoyable. But Please remember this is my opinion and it is prone to flaws and further changes.\nHOPE YOU LIKE IT.",

This creates a sense of urgency and danger that keeps readers hooked. However, the plot often feels repetitive and predictable due to the main character's overwhelming knowledge and abilities. It used to be very good at the beginning but now it's just falling apart.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is fast-paced and action-packed, with high stakes that add excitement. The inclusion of streaming and a coin store adds interesting layers to the narrative, though they sometimes feel like unnecessary complications. The reliance on convenient solutions and the main character's invincibility can detract from the tension and excitement.\n\nCharacters:\n\nJinhyuk, the protagonist, is overly powerful, knowing everything about the game and possessing perfect memory. His ability to copy other players' skills further reduces the story's tension. While some side characters, like Teresa, receive decent development, many others are one-dimensional and serve mainly as tools for Jinhyuk or as his allies without much depth.\n\nArt:\n\nThe art by Redice Studio is solid, enhancing the story with dynamic action scenes and detailed character designs. The depiction of the tower and its various floors is vivid and engaging, adding to the overall appeal.\n\nOverall:\n\n\"Solo Max-Level Newbie\" is a decent read for fans of action-fantasy manhwa, especially those who enjoy game-world narratives. It has some cool moments and a unique premise but is held back by the main character's invincibility and reliance on plot conveniences. Give it a try for 10-20 chapters to see if it hooks you, but be prepared for a story that feels like a mash-up of familiar tropes and ideas.\n\nRating: 7.86/10\n\nPLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS MY OPINION AND IT IS PRONE TO FLAWS AND CHANGES and please follow me on Disqus (AlphaEruditeWhizz) and insta (farzaan._.25)\n\n",

      "selftext": "These two as obviously they are together, and I'm not lying. For 5 to 6 chapters streight we have only seem them go on dates.... I don't care what anyone says but it was boring as fuck seeing them just loving eachother and not showing any other characters exept them, we see other characters but they aren't even relevant. I would have preferred how the other characters see these two now that they are together. I could care less about them, everyone expected it but they still act surprised because they are good-looking characters. The story was slow and boring, unlike last season where I felt there were missing pieces everywhere I didn't need this one to be slow JUST to show that these two love eactother. And I'll even have to wait an entire week just for these two..... I'm more interested in Dohwa, some of you may think it's because I wanted him to be with the fml but she's outright horrible, the same goes for any other character there wouldn't be a character that we know that would fit Dohwa. There, I said it. I started reading this as a joke to myself that ended in some people wanting to see me post and I did it because I enjoyed it. But even after I looked at the Q&A I was still left with unanswered questions, and by the looks of it the readers ar just as dance as the fml. Yeah, it's a good read only if you like to read it with your brain of, I shouldn't even be mad, I'm the one that read it and decided to continue, honesty, the writer herself is good at writing infuriating and likable characters. It story itself isn't even complex its so simple that it makes you wonder how it didn't just end in the first season and then followed by an aftermath of like 1 or 2 chapters. The only complex thing about this whole story is Dohwa. I think that the 1 season ended perfectly even when there were loose ends that weren't met.\nOverall I enjoyed the 1 season, the only good thing for now was how Eunhyeok was nice yo that little piano boy, yes, it was a chapter that didn't include her much.",

In the novel one single religion exist which is like Christianity (but has distinct difference also) and has churches later they had internel conflict about fundamentals and seperated into two seperate groups. Original is now call old faith but was originally call xeruam or something. And separated one is called new faith but also has a proper name. (Don't remember the proper names since we mainly use old or new faith because it's easier to understand) . Anyways last time when this church and all was discussed the translator used catholic and Protestant directly rather than using the proper names which upsated me a lot but I let it go because I thought they will fix it or somebody will tell them to fix it but no it didn't happen.

But he manages to make some friends.\n\nThere is a important moment in the story where during a tournament arc, one of MC's friends gets corrupted due to a betrayal leading to the whole friend group disbanding and mc being alone.\n\nAfter a time skip, mc finally trains with his powers enough to the point he actually becomes pretty skilled and strong.\n\nMc also had a love interest who had a tragic backstory where her entire family and neighbourhood feared her and tried to kill her, causing her to accidentally create an earthquake that killed everyone.\n\nThe main villain was a bad guy who once was a student of the academy but when he found his powers were cursed, the school tried to kill him instead.

I'm not mad but it wakes no sense to me on why someone should feel like they are interrupting some when the person they are talking to is literally on the other side of the road...... no hate to anyone, I just needed someone to hate and it just fell on this innocent soul, returning back at subject. Su-re is finally doing the thing she should have done since the beninging! Ans she found an article about how the CEO probably lIkes BROV* and you can just see that the poster of the article is not an artist or a writer and is just me in disguise just trying to find something to hate-\nPalpalhan 88 aka the CEO Of ME* tipes like a tiktok comment section, bro was do disappointed by the ending he just stared at the screen, he may be a stalker but he is so real for this. \nDogwa was really in his emo era in middle school, honestly, if his middle school \"friend\" was still his friend after he found out my boy was poor, I would have shipped this...TOXIC YAOI- and what kind of man says \"those kind of perfect proportions\" to the guy he hates?

I hoped that the studio would select a story that matched the quality of Suicide Hunter but for me this was a complete miss. \n\nChapter one might as well be a chapter zero since the twenty chapters that are out has absolutely nothing to do with the nineteen chapters that follow. Then we follow up with the events of chapter ten that leads to a questionable ||10 chapters of illusion? Or maybe it\u2019s 10 chapters of a possessed brother?|| Either way it is nearly impossible to follow. The pacing is all over the place, and the characters are barely a shell. \n\nI\u2019m curious if anyone has any positive feelings regarding this, or if maybe the source material is just not suited for the manhwa format.

You can guess I like academy genre's. Anyway this is actually not about Manhwas genre but book genres instead. I have read a few light novels after starting their respective Manhwas, and like most of you are fine with light novels. Which brings me to my topic, Litrpg books! I just want to recommend them to anyone who has not heard of this genre. Of the few I have tried they have a similar feel to system manhwas. The few I have read include; he who fights with monsters, dungeon born, and murder hobo. I have another I want to try called dungeon crawler carl. \n\nTLDR: Try out LITRPG books if you're a fan of system manhwa's or are looking for something similar.",

Now I get why he was tomatoed and egged, and her points have gone up! And if her total points are still at zero them we can be sure that it doesn't work at it should. And wft is wrong with Minji? Even when you don't know the details at least be worried and wonder what happened instead of joining in and accusing her of cheating, Ajin and Yeseo are the best, and props to her for clearing up what happened. And I've been seeing a lot of people that don't like or hate on people that ship, Dowha and Eunhyeok, idk why buy I feel like it low key makes sense, you can think of it as enemies to lovers, and the funny thing is, you can put Su-ae eith anyone, exept her ex-boy of course, and no one would be mad, she can be put with either one of the male leads and no one would be mad, you can also put her with her friend, Ajin and I guarantee that some would be mad confused but they wouldn't even mind in the end because for us they knew eachother for like 3 months but in the manwha they were friends even before that so they kinda work together....",

Honestly, I don't really remember anything in detail, and even the details I do remember I'm not too sure about lol! But here it goes:\n\n* Korean manhwa or webtoon\n* Historical setting (old Korea)\n* Lead is a female with short-black(or rlllly dark blue) hair and blue eyes, usually wearing a blue hanbok, and always gets assumed to be a child/younger than she is because of her small stature and young looks\n* She is a doctor? Healer? and travels around on her own and then forms a small party with (i think) one or two other people going from place to place\n* I think in the first chapter they're in the forest when one of the poeple that ends up joining her, stumbles upon her as she's watering her horse by a river (or something like that lol)\n* I don't remember it necessarily being a romance, but more about her travels as she heals people?\n* I wanna say her name has the syllable \"Moon\" in it...I don't know if it's her last name, or part of her first name\n\nIf anyone can help me, I would appreciate it so much !!",

      "selftext": "3 main criteria for characters gaining immense strength. **Talent, good items, and teachers.**\n\nZephyr and Aedi are extremely capable fighters thanks to their incredible teachers. \n\n**Aedi\u2019s Teachers:**\n\n* White Dragon - taught him since childhood, really good foundations thanks to that. (6 years)\n\n* Ice Dragon - Most important teacher that meteorically boosted his fighting capabilities. Taught him for just 3 months and he was already capable of fighting as a vanguard in the blue dragon raid. (3 months)\n\nPre-regression Zephyr had a pretty late start, he didn\u2019t really start training till he was around 21 years old.\n**Zephyr\u2019s Teachers:**\n\n* Ned: taught him the dragon king style martial arts which helped build the foundation of his strength. (approx 1 year)\n\n* Fade: taught him poison techniques and how to hunt monsters (not sure about martial arts or fighting humans tho). (???)\n\n* Altair: taught him the skills to block the mana channels of mages to combat against them. (???)\n\n* Blue Dragon: his battle senses were dramatically heightened thanks to her beating the shit out of him and healing him over and over till he defeated her. (1 month)\n\n* Notable mention: White dragon never got to train him but she did sense potential in him.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNext are items that helped them become strong enough to fight the Blue Dragon in its half-dead state. For Zephyr he had the Black Dragon Heart and Gram. For Aedi he had the Lion armor and Requiem. \n**Let\u2019s talk about the Blue Dragon Raid:**\n\nIt took two vanguards Aedi and Fade to beat the Blue Dragon. For Zephyr, he was the only vanguard to beat the dragon, but then again it\u2019s his second time fighting the Blue dragon.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nYou could say Aedi had a headstart compared to Zephyr. But Zephyr has waaay more experience fighting absurdly strong enemies than the former.\n\n**TL;DR** I still have no idea who is more talented. Their circumstances are way too different from each other to compare properly. What if Zephyr got to train with the Ice dragon instead without a dragon heart? What if Aedi had lived to the end of the world like Zephyr did and regressed? What do you guys think?\n",

I think he can also use thier abilities or gets stronger with them I can't remember and in one of the chapter they are fighting in some sort of tournament with them. \nI know it's not much to go on but I'm at my wit's wnd trying to figure out what the title is any help would be appreciated thanks.",

I can't remember if the MC went out there or it started there, but shortly there's an almost cataclysmic event, and the MC is helped by a female character who's part of the main attack force. \n\nA few other bits I remember is someone wearing a red full body suit, almost like a futuristic armor, and the MC suddenly gains powers very early on and ends up being the one to help the female who tried to help him. \n\n\nI know this is probably similar to countless others, so if I remember more I'll update, but any help is greatly appreciated as I want to read it again.",
