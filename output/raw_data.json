      "selftext": "I had been following the boxer since it had around 20 chapters and I had absolutely fallen in love. It made me look forward Thursdays every week. I loved it but it wasn\u2019t quite no. 1 for me until Chapter 32 came out.\n\nI love the chapters so much I used to save pocket money every month so that I could buy some chapters through fast pass. **Not just cause I wanted to read them soon but more so cause I wanted to support the Author in whatever way I could through WEBTOON.**\n\nHere\u2019s this review I wrote after chapter 32 went live. (I was 20 years old back then)\n\n**START**\n\nShort Review:-\nTHIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST THING I HAVE EVERY READ!\n\nNow, on a less hyper note. The storyline might not seem very unique initially but as soon as you reach around chapter 3-5, you will know that it is in fact very unique. While the plot itself is S tier, the actual strength of this series is its storytelling, which is impeccable.\nThe art is very unorthodox and unique and the general vibe that it gives made me a fan immediately, furthermore it does a perfect job to create the atmosphere/vibe that the author wants to convey. The dialogues are everything!\n\nLong Review:-\n\nStory/plot (9-10/10):-\nYou might go in expecting your usual underdog fighter story along the lines of something like Baki or Kengan Ashura but this series is fundamentally very different from most fighting related series.\nWhile the story might be revolving around the world of boxing, the actual emphasis of the series has always been upon its characters and their journey.\n\nThe story by itself is very good too, but I would only give it 9/10, but what takes this to 10/10 is the way that the story is being told. There's a very huge difference between what a plot is and how it is delivered. In my opinion, the main strength of this series is how it paces itself and goes from panel to panel.\n\nAfter having seen and read a certain amount of series, you develop a general idea of where a story might go but what makes a story great is how it takes you there. A perfect example of this would be my favourite Anime which is Violet Evergarden, because in it there is hardly any episode where you don't know what the end result is going to be, however, despite your knowledge Violet Evergarden manages to deliver the emotional impact. Similarly, while the boxer's story as a whole might not be that predictable but on a chapter to chapter basis, you will find yourself knowing what is going to happen eventually but the series still delivers the emotional impact nonetheless.\n\nFurthermore, the story on a macro scale has been built in such a way that there are essentially infinite possibilities in the future and that is what makes it a thrill to read.\n\nP.S: This is actually one of the only series where I'm satisfied regardless of whether there is a fight or major progress plot wise. This is mainly because even if the chapter I'm reading does not have any action and is full of interactions, the delivery of each and every one of these interactions is just amazing which makes it a treat to read regardless.\n\nArt (10/10):-\nThe art style of the series is very unorthodox and different from what one would usually encounter and while it might now be the most detailed or hyper-realistic, it does in fact suit the series perfectly.\n\nActually, the art is the reason I started reading this Manhwa/webtoon in the first place, I was scrolling trying to find something to read and saw the cover page of the series and was instantly drawn to it. The art in my opinion, is very captivating and does a superb job of delivering the vibe that the author wants it to give.\n\nThe saying \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is true and this series takes advantage of it to a huge extent. Since a lot of the storytelling is also done by the subtle touches that the author provides in their panels.\n\nCharacters (9-10/10):-\nAs I mentioned above, the series gives a huge amount of importance to its characters and they are what makes this series so great.\n\nThe author has made a very diverse set of characters with very unique and interesting designs and they have all been given an ample amount of spotlight which allows for their characters to have a considerable depth and a lot of them have a lot of potential and plot significance.\nAnd the reason why my score for the characters has a 9 before the 10 is similar to the plot. Because, in my opinion, the characters are very good, but they are not the most unique or deep characters out there because it is not like these characters have 20 chapters of backstory or interactions, but the thing that makes these characters great is that, the author flushes them out very cleverly through the limited amount of backstory and interactions that they are given.\n\nThe characters are introduced and shown in such a way that the reader becomes deeply attached to each and every one of them. It is hard to explain how these characters who only have limited time to be explored become very realistic and deep due to the storytelling. I can only explain it by saying that the author chooses the right things to highlight about their backgrounds and their actions, body language and dialogues along with the scenery make the reader understand the basics of their character and that makes the connection between the readers and characters deep.\n\nThe attachment to most characters is developed so well that during the boxing matches, the readers will often find themselves torn between the competitors. Additionally, many characters that might seem to belong to a certain archetype often turn out to be very different which is always fun to witness.\n\nDialogue writing and character chemistry (10/10):-\nThis right here is the bread and butter of this series. All the dialogues are fairly simple and have many undertones which keep getting revealed as time goes on. The dialogues by themselves hardly seem very poetic or meaningful on their own but they shine as a whole.\n\nThe dialogues and character interactions have been well thought out and none of them ever violate the characters basic nature and are therefore complementary to their psychological standpoints, this makes the characters seem natural and realistic. Which helps the series seem more lifelike as a whole.\n\nThe interactions between the characters are always very fluid and natural. They never fail in advancing any character's agendas and personal arcs. The dialogues and interactions give the series infinite possibilities since the author has created so many characters with the potential to be the main character and has so not given away the ultimate conclusion that the series plans to reach.\n\nOverall (11/10):-\nThis Webtoon is nothing short of a masterpiece which knows exactly how to balance the character development with its main plotline. Its usage of its characters is very unique and the way that it uses the undertones of the dialogue and backstories adds a lot of weight and depth when combined with the subtle symbolism through the scenery and body language. And while this story is already a masterpiece, it essentially has unlimited potential due to the number of possibilities and therefore it has the promise to become something beyond a masterpiece, something that can define an era.\n\n**END**\n\nIt\u2019s still my no.1 till date and will probably stay there unless Ember Knight has a banger ending. I might write a new review for it in the future but that\u2019s for another day.\n\nLove **YU** all",

I thought we'd stay in the high school arc for wayyyyy longer, but I was totally wrong. !<\n\n>! The fact that both Eunhyeok and Dohwa both kinda dissapeared from her life for a similar length of period and at the same time kinda took me by surprise ngl. !< I just know the second ml syndrome is gonna way worse in this arc. But I'm actually looking forward how it'll all circle back between these three + welp that annoying blonde gal. I wanna say I'm super frustrated how the writer abruptly dealt with the chapter but I guess it was kinda needed because everything was feeling super repetitive. I'm actually excited to read this again and I'm hoping we get to see a new side to Sooae >! since well I'm at least hoping 10 years gave her room for SOME growth right. !< But I really did enjoy the narration of her thoughts in this chapter. >!

So in the end he easily gets rid of them with ice and fire magic, he does use a sword too.\n\nLater down the line he raids a goblin village, where one of the villagers helping to sort out the loot gets posessed by a dark marble he stole from a goblin corpse.   \nThrough that villager the mc gets attacked by a necromancer, after all that he meets a lady knight which in game was supposed to be a bloody revenger or something like that. So her, the mc and her lackey go on a journey to hunt down the necromancer, his hideout is in a graveyard tomb in the middle of cursed forest.\n\nOh and the world is apparently divided by some sort of mist that makes people go crazy, idk if that helps.",

      "selftext": "So I was just scrolling through pinterest and came across an image that really blew my mind.\n\nIt was a frame (I think it was from a manhwa, not manhua) of a guy looking up at a huge portrait of a queen/empress. The art style is very unique, a little messy looking. It looks more like a sketch or storyboard than an actual frame from a manhwa. But it's in color\n\nThe queen/empress in the portrait has a big smile, but like a scary dangerous smile, not a happy smile. I think she has dark hair\n\nI was just staring at the image and my ass accidentally scrolled up and so the site reloaded. PLEASE if anyone knows what this is, save me!!!",

      "selftext": "I feel like everything I've ever read in manhwa/manga is the \"best\" I've ever read. Like sure I loved reading SSS suicide hunter, Absolute Sword Sense, the tutorial is too hard, Regression instruction manual etc but love? feels like a long shot. Recently I've been thinking about how I perceive this form of literature/art. It's short and bite-sized, usually (and hopefully) once a week hence extremely easy to digest. I can read it on the train to work/school and back, any 5 min break I get i can check if there's a new update and finish the chapter in 5 mins. It honestly atp feels like watching a reel on Instagram. Like a reel, the high is fast and quick and then vanished until I search for the next hit of a different action/murim comic. Like i reel, i am never satisfied i just want more and more and more. Many of these comics/stories have very interesting ideas conveyed, don't get me wrong but i rarely find myself looking back on them. I never relish the ideas, live through the ideas or put the idea in my real life. I miss when art used to make me feel something. For example, although full of flaws themselves but nevertheless looking back on Naruto and fairy tail, the idea of never giving up still resonates with me, novels like 1984 and their ideas of doublethink stick to my soul and changed how i perceive the world, the more I read retellings of epic stories like the Mahabharata like the palace of illusions i get new perspectives and love. I feel like manhwa or manga due to their short-form bite-sized nature, fast novel-to-adaptation speed which leaves out lots of detail, the lack of personal imagination required, and the need for \"hype\" moments despite having an average premise/story makes them one of the worst experiences, in the same category as reels and tiktoks in modern and in my life. They are another epitome of the joyless wonders of modern society until the writer dies of overwork, the studio cancels the work so the ending gets rushed or cancels all english translations posted online.

She then makes a bet with her dad that she doesnt need his money and she can make her own, but the catch is that she cant tell anyone she is actually rich or who her parents are. Once she leaves the house she see this guy who fell into the water and was drowing. She goes after to save him and they kiss. She eventually finds a job opening at these rich highschool dudes house as a maid. Theres a bunch of girls who were also applying for this position, but they all looked down on MC because they thought she was poor. The MC eventually wins the position through her flower arrangement, which was a test to see if they were qualified. After getting hired, she meets the guy she saved from drowing again, however it is not actually him but his twin brother. She eventually gets together with the guy she saved but his mother extremely disapproves of their relationship because she is \u201cpoor\u201d.

      "selftext": "\\[ **WARNING -** A long paragraph of my personal experience while reading the story + some insights, maybe\\]  >!(***Also, Spoiler Free, pretty much)*** !<\n\n***TL;DR - Basically shared my experience. If you want to feel something similar; Go and read PigPen if you haven't already. It's an underrated gem.***\n\n**Preface** - I have been a huge fan of Carnby Kim's works for the last **3-4 years** or so, his first being, the manhwa titled \"*B@st@rd*\". *B@st@rd* and *Sweet Home* were my immediate favorites. I do not think I have had ever enjoyed reading a Manhwa before as I did with those two. The thrill, the excitement, the lore, the cliffhangers; were felt pretty simplistic but spot-on.\n\nThere was this another Webtoon that was in the talk but not as popular as those previous titles. Yes, the post's title gives it away, but it's named \"*PigPen\".*\n\nHonestly, I didn't expect much from the Story for some reason. I knew it was a Thriller (and I love my thrillers) but I was afraid of reading it due to the fact that I'd somehow feel a bit disappointed? I mean, I've already read two masterpieces by the same guy, so he possibly can't really have more, right?\n\nThat idea itself kind of delayed my interest and kept the work at hold for like over 3-4 years now. First forward to last week, I finally decided give the manhwa a green signal and I started reading it on WebToon.\n\nAt first, I didn't really like the art style as it didn't feel like a \"*Carnby Kim's stories type Art*\" because I was adapted to the *Hwang Young-Chan*'s artworks. But after a few chapters in, they already grew on me. In fact, now that I think about it, it was the perfect art style they could have gone for given how the story is.\n\nOh boy, it was NOT what I expected it to be, at ALL. I don't think I've read a Manhwa (thus far) that has THAT many amount of Plot Twists in just a minimum amount of chapters. The way the entire scenarios were set, felt like it was a cake walk for the authors. It was so smoothly executed.\n\nThe best part of the story is its characters. It's like you juggle between hating a character to liking a character and *vice versa.* You just do not know/predict what the next chapter stores for you.

The ending, especially, may become a bit confusing/disappointing for some readers but I can understand why. It ends abruptly, leaving the readers to question themselves and conclude with an answer by the given provided clues throughout the series (or atleast the final arc).

      "selftext": "\\[ **WARNING -** A long paragraph of my personal experience while reading the story + some insights, maybe\\]  >!(***Also, Spoiler Free, pretty much)*** !<\n\n***TL;DR - Basically shared my experience. If you want to feel something similar; Go and read PigPen if you haven't already. It's an underrated gem.***    \n\n**Preface** - I have been a huge fan of Carnby Kim's works for the last **3-4 years** or so, his first being, the manhwa titled \"*Bastard*\". *Bastard* and *Sweet Home* were my immediate favorites. I do not think I have had ever enjoyed reading a Manhwa before as I did with those two. The thrill, the excitement, the lore, the cliffhangers; were felt pretty simplistic but spot-on.  \n  \nThere was this another Webtoon that was in the talk but not as popular as those previous titles. Yes, the post's title gives it away, but it's named \"*PigPen\".*   \n  \nHonestly, I didn't expect much from the Story for some reason. I knew it was a Thriller (and I love my thrillers) but I was afraid of reading it due to the fact that I'd somehow feel a bit disappointed? I mean, I've already read two masterpieces by the same guy, so he possibly can't really have more, right?  \n  \nThat idea itself kind of delayed my interest and kept the work at hold for like over 3-4 years now. First forward to last week, I finally decided give the manhwa a green signal and I started reading it on WebToon.  \n\nAt first, I didn't really like the art style as it didn't feel like a \"*Carnby Kim's stories type Art*\" because I was adapted to the *Hwang Young-Chan*'s artworks. But after a few chapters in, they already grew on me. In fact, now that I think about it, it was the perfect art style they could have gone for given how the story is.   \n\nOh boy, it was NOT what I expected it to be, at ALL. I don't think I've read a Manhwa (thus far) that has THAT many amount of Plot Twists in just a minimum amount of chapters. The way the entire scenarios were set, felt like it was a cake walk for the authors. It was so smoothly executed. \n\nThe best part of the story is its characters. It's like you juggle between hating a character to liking a character and *vice versa.* You just do not know/predict what the next chapter stores for you. It has so many unique turns that it almost makes it impossible (at least for a dumb guy like me) to comprehend its possible outcomes. \n\nPigPen is one of those titles that feel like you would want to revisit every 2-3 years because of how shockingly good the content of the story possess.\n\nHowever, even if it's amazing, there are some parts that might turn off the readers if they're not careful.

Main lead reincarnated into a body that had dark magic and the other girl reincarnated into a body that had light magic. A war breaks out and main lead goes to the warzone, uses dark magic to bind the enemy, and everyone goes back alive. When returning, the girl with light magic accuses her of being a killer as she originally killed everyone in the book.\n\n\n\nI think there is romance with the crown prince but not sure.\n\n\n\nThink there was also a controversy where she was blessed by a dark spirit and it caused her skin to go from being tanned to pure white, but that may be another story (If it is could you also tell me the title to that one)\n\n\n\nIf you need any more follow up questions I will answer the best I can.",

I believe because she couldn't use the family's special magic, she was kicked out of the mansion. She then drowned in a lake and her magician ancestor takes over her body. The main little girl is still alive but the ancestor controls her body and they can communicate in a \"dream world\"\n\nThe magician ancestor learns that her descendants have this \"kicking a child out of the house\" practice and plans to bring the family to ruin. She makes contact with one of her old acquaintances who is a dragon and they pretend that the ancestor is the dragon's daughter so that the family doesn't know the girl is still alive.\n\nThat's all I can remember.

      "selftext": "The story is a romance and i think the main character has pink hair? (maybe). She is the only dayghter of this rich family, but her dad cuts her off of hos money and she moves out to go male her own money. While she was walking around she sees this guy with blue hair fall into the water and she jumps in to save him cuz he was drowing. She eventually finds a job opening at these rich guys house as a live in maid. I think she won the position thru her flower arrangement, which was a test for all the applicants to see if they were qualified. Everyone there looked down on her because they thought she was poor. When she got hired as the maid at these boys house she met the guy that she had saved while drowing. But he is really rude and acts like he doesnt know her, this is because he isnt really the guy but his twin brother. Later on in the story she gets together with the guy she saved, but his mother gets in their way because she thinks the main character is poor and doesnt like her because of that. Later on in the story, it was revealed that she wasn\u2019t actually poor, but a part of the 5 richest families. I\u2019m pretty sure all the characters are in highschool. (sorry i know this description is really bad and vague, but if anyone has any clue pls helpp)",

      "selftext": "1. Flow - The watercolor art style is so pretty and the story goes so insanely hard\n\n2. Amongst Us -  hands down the best slice of life I've ever read\n\n     - One and two are interchangeable. I really love both but considering they are from 2 different genres I don't know how to compare the two.\n\n3. Frieren - There's a lot of good things to say about this manga but above all else it helped me reconcile with the fact that all good things must end\n\n4. Unordinary - before i get shit for saying this I know UnO isn't that good but I've been reading this since it first dropped so its very nostalgic for me. Perhaps not one of the best but surely one of my favorites.\n\n5. Horimiya - Another great slice of life story. Pretty much drama free. Just happy people being happy.\n\n6. Hero Killer - The fight scenes in this manhwa give me chills. The art style, the abilities, the characters the world building and the sheer magnitude of the attacks just UGH. CHILLS!\n\n7. Ending Maker - The 'reincarnated into a video game' troupe is generally over used and bland but this one does it pretty well.\n\n8. Doom Breaker - I typically dislike regression manhwa but Doom Breaker I like. Its quite popular so I don't think I need to say much about it.\n\n9. Our Secret Alliance - I'm a slice of life fan in case you didn't notice. This manhwa is pure sugar. Definitely made me uncomfortable at times (most of the time) but in a good way.\n\n10. Infinite mage - It was not ruined by Amy. On a more serious note I quite like the magic system in this one.",
